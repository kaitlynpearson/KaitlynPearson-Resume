        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-businessüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a pre-business student and I intend to have a concentration in marketing. I attend the University of California, Riverside, and I am currently a second-year student. I want to go into marketing since I like the creative aspect of it and I would like to make posters or online ads showcasing items that a company is selling.<br><br>

        In 2019, I worked in sales for a few months selling kitchen items. It was a good experience for me since I am a very quiet and shy person and that job helped me move a little out of my comfort zone. I had to call up some people that I knew and some people that I did not know. Calling up people I knew was already hard since I didn‚Äôt want to feel awkward by asking them if they would like to purchase items, since that was not a conversation I ever thought I would have with them. After I would talk to the people I knew, I would get recommendations for some people they knew that I could sell to. Talking to people I did not know was not as difficult since I had never spoken to them before and therefore, they had very little previous thoughts about me. I knew I would never have to see or speak to them again and so I was less nervous about selling to them. This whole experience was very new to me, and while it was nerve-wracking at times, it helped me become less anxious talking to new people. This experience also helped me because it helped me practice what I was going to say and how I was going to talk to people. I had a pamphlet, but not necessarily a script, so I had to come up with my own ‚Äúscript‚Äù and go off of that in order to make recommendations and help people decide what they would like.<br><br>

        I also worked at Del Taco for a year from September 2019 to September 2020. This job was really scary the first few times I went since I had to actually interact with a lot more people rather than just the few I would talk to other so often at my previous job. I had to learn what to say to people and speak up a lot more. Working here really helped me get a lot more out of my comfort zone because I couldn‚Äôt just sit back and watch, I would have to interact with people to ask how their meals were or if they needed anything. If we had gotten someone‚Äôs order wrong and they came to ask for a refund or were upset, I would have to help them and talk through what they wanted and maybe offer them a free drink. After a person had ordered, but before I rang up the total, I would ask if they wanted to add another item for a dollar or two more. This used to be really scary for me but over time I was able to feel less nervous and ask them. This job also helped me by learning my way around a fast food restaurant. I have never worked at another fast food restaurant, but many places are fairly similar. I would get items from the back and stock up the straws, utensils, or sauces. I learned how to make some of the drinks as well, like the shakes, tea, and coffee.
